# research-journal


Display view of the Research Journal

The journal contains 3 panels – Left, center, and right. Left and right pannel should be collapsable (with a – minus sign).

In the left panel, there will be the following options:
1. User Name (with a drop down > arrow): when one clicks on the dropdown arrow, the following comes: settings, switch workspace with a > which when hovered results in option (when hovered it will have list of workspace which when clicked, one gets to that workspace which is basiclaly a new research journal altogether. It also has + new workspace tab which when clicked results in a prompt asking the name of new workspace. On submission, a new research journal is created. All this happens in dropdown wihtout change in center pannel.
2. Then there will be Home, Library, and Agent tab.
2.1. In home tab, when clicked, center pannel changes such that: it has quick actions: user can upload a file in diffeerent folders or to library directly, create to create a note, chat or folder, a chat with a file option which when clicked asks for the file/ files and a right tab opens up a chat where the RAG is limited to that file/files, and chat with a folder option that lets user chat with RAG limited to files in that folder.
2.2. When user clicks on library tab, the center pannel changes to show list of all the files/books/notes, in the library. In the center pannel is the display button which changes view to either table view or tab view. In table view, it displays the list of all the resorces the user added to the library. This will also have sort option to sort by folder, title, authors, visibilty, etc. And a filter tab to do the filter again on basis of different columns. When one clicks on display button, the columsn to view in the table option also comes. In tab view, the resource file is opened and showed to the user. One can open many such files and they open in different tabs in the center panel (like it happens in web browser tabs).
2.3. In agent tab, the center pannel changes to show the chat view. Here user can use @ in the chat which results in a dropdown of list of agents the user can use, the folders to RAG from, the files to RAG from, and the list of tools like web search, search workspace, search papers, search youtube, create citations, create image, search Zotero, etc. Below the chat there @Mention (on clicking which is another way that one opens up this list described above), model downdown: gpt, qwen, claude, word limit-250 words, 500 words, etc. And a knob: clicking which results in a dropdown to workspace, internet, model knowledge, language, citation format (numbered, APA, MLA, etc.). Then there is + button to attach files or connect more apps, and top arrow button to submit the chat. When clicked or when user presses enter, the chat goes to the selected language model, with selected tools, selected agents, selected RAG scope and the response from the LLM is generated and returned in the selected langauge and cited in the format selected. The main thing is that the user can click the citation number and get to the document section or list of document sections where the RAG was taken to get proper context of why LLM generated what it did. All that is selected should become blue or either have a tick mark next to it. 
3. Then on the left pannel is a private section: with tabs to the folders user created. The user can create subfolders within each folder where they can arrange their chats, notes, files, etc. 

Use anara.com format, fonts, etc. The above description is of that itself, and generate me the frontend in django or nodejs whichever one is easier. I am also attaching images for interactions with the UI for reference.
